to set up react using vite 
here "create" is a utility
first type npm create vite@latest
then enter the project name
then choose the framework: React
selet variant : javaScript

when made project using vite node module is not present there 
now to download type:-> npm install
to run project type -> npm run dev

the function name should start from capital letter
and we have to use export and import

we can only return 1 element
so to return multiple element we need to enclose them in a div and to stop using div everytime they give us a "fragment" <> this is a fragmant </> tag with no name.
